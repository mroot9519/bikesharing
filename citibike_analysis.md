# Question
Should the bike program be oriented towards customers or subscribers?

Bike program should be oriented toward subscribers as they are 81% of the user population.

Given the fluctuation in the share of overall ridership, my analysis infers the behavior of both subscribers and customers. For instance, given the subscribers greater ownership in the early morning, it can be assume that thisis due to locals commuting to work, and the customers larger share in the afternoon due to one-off torust activities

# Subscribers
For subscribers, ridership peaks in the morning, betweeen 6 and 9. I infer this is due to the morning commute. Location-wise, the stations should be in densly populated and business centers of Des Moines, particularly downtown Des Moines.

# Commuters
Customer trips are twice as long as subscriber trips. I ifner this is due to customers' tourist-nature. These should be located along the various trails, outside Historic East Village, Blank Park Zoo, and other tourist locations. 

## Overlap
The largest bike docking stations should be at locations which include both customers and subscribers.
